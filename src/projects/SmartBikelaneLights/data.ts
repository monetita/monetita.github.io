  title: "Smart bikelane lights",
  shortDescription: "designed smart lights that light up when a pedestrian is about to collide with a bike. The lights light up a 3-second span from the bikes to the pedestrian",
  longDescription: "This project addresses urban safety challenges by designing an intelligent lighting system for bike lanes. The smart lights use motion sensors and predictive algorithms to detect potential collisions between cyclists and pedestrians. When a collision risk is detected, the system illuminates a 3-second warning path from the approaching bike to the pedestrian, giving both parties time to react. The system integrates seamlessly into existing bike lane infrastructure and uses energy-efficient LED technology. This design solution demonstrates how technology can enhance urban safety and reduce accidents in shared spaces.",
