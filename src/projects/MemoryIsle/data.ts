  title: "Memory Isle",
  shortDescription: "a web game that allows users to explore a world where the interactions they have with their surroundings affect the mood of the game. Good interactions will make the world bloom and everyone happy, while bad interactions will make the world dark and gloomy",
  longDescription: "Memory Isle is an interactive web-based game that explores the relationship between player actions and environmental storytelling. Players navigate through a beautifully rendered world where every interaction has consequences. Positive actions—such as helping characters, solving puzzles cooperatively, or making thoughtful choices—cause the world to bloom with color, music becomes uplifting, and characters become happier. Conversely, negative actions darken the world, change the atmosphere, and affect the narrative. The game serves as both entertainment and a reflection on how our choices impact our environment and relationships. Built with modern web technologies, Memory Isle demonstrates skills in game design, interactive storytelling, and front-end development.",
